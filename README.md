**Live site:** https://www.strategickminds.com/

## What's inside

- **Top 10 models** — each explained in 3 layers: a story you'll remember, an animated SVG diagram, and the formal equation (KaTeX-rendered): Nash equilibrium, Prisoner's Dilemma, repeated games, zero-sum, sequential, simultaneous, mixed strategies, cooperative games, bargaining, Stackelberg.
- **3 playable labs** — iterated Prisoner's Dilemma vs. Tit-for-Tat, a penalty-kick game with an *adaptive* goalie that punishes predictable play (mixed strategies), and a coffee-price war where you can feel the Nash equilibrium click.
- **20 flip flashcards** — all 20 frameworks with intuition + equation on the back.
- **Cheat sheet** — situation → model → memory hook.
- **Level Up section** — a learning path, pop-culture strategy moments, and an interactive quiz.
- **Channel roadmap** — Season 1 episode plan for the YouTube/TikTok channel.
